## Relics
Initial list of uniques were gathered in [this reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/97gmte/actual_list_of_151_reliquary_items/). Updates:
- `The Retch` cannot be produced as relic
- `The Taming` can be produced as relic
- There are no relic maps
- The following relics don't seem to drop: `Fate of the Vaal`, `Night's Hold`, `Natural Hierarchy`. Reasons are unknown, suspected bug (sources: [1](https://www.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/9ejqeu/bugged_there_are_0_fate_of_the_vaal_sword_opened/), [2](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2214627/page/1#p15802185)).

This puts the current count at a round 150. Have fun collecting exiles!
