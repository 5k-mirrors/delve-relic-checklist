## Relics
[GGG announced](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2197540) 151 relics. An initial list of 157 were gathered in [this reddit post](https://old.reddit.com/r/pathofexile/comments/97gmte/actual_list_of_151_reliquary_items/). Updates:
- `The Beachhead` cannot drop and cannot be produced as relic (Harbinger's Orbs cannot be used on the unique relic Perandus Manor map)
- As of [3.4.3d](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2232076) `Fate of the Vaal` can drop
- As of [3.4.3f](https://www.pathofexile.com/forum/view-thread/2239037) `Night's Hold` and `Natural Hierarchy` can drop, `The Retch` can be produced
- 2-socket abyss uniques are not counted separately

This puts the current known count at 156. Have fun collecting exiles!
